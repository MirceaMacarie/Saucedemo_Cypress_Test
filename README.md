## :pushpin: Inspiration and personal purpose :chart_with_upwards_trend:
An automation testing project written with Cypress JS framework. It was developed in order to understand better how Cypress functions work and to developed an End-to-end user flow on the demo shopping website https://www.saucedemo.com/, where I tested more functionalities and details.






## :pushpin: Project technologies :computer:
+ **JavaScript** as programming language
+ **Node.js** as runtime environment
+ **Cypress** as automation framework for web applications
+ **Google Chrome** as test browser

## :pushpin: Setup and installation :hammer_and_wrench:	
1. The first time I created a remote repository on GitHub, then a local repository on my computer.
2. In the project's local folder, I installed the **Cypress** automatic testing framework from the Command Prompt, by executing the command: "npm i cypress".
3. After the final installation of Cypress, I had to open it by command line "npx cypress open" in Command Prompt and configure the framework for this project: selecting the type of testing for this project (End-to-End Testing), selecting the Google Chrome browser to run the website, create and setting the specific folder of the JavaScript test code (in this case: **"cypress\e2e\History_Tests"**).
4. After I have finished configuring Cypress for this project, I open a JS code file in the **"cypress\e2e\Sauce_Test_File.cy.js"** folder and add the unitary organized test suite with proper names for all the tests in it, following the documentation of Cypress framework.
5. The automated test suite is executed by running in the Cypress interface, with a generic report in the left and the visual execution of the tests in the right part. During execution, I put more breaks in the testing code execution, such that every different test case to be more easily observed. 






## :pushpin: Web support :link:
As support, I used **the website https://www.saucedemo.com/** for these automation test.






## :pushpin: Testing objectives :microscope:
This project was thought as a way to: 
+ if **it respects a Positive Flow for a customer who wants to check the website and to buy a product**, 
+ **to check certain static or functional details (buttons, titles, text, etc.)**,
+ developed more **different test cases for specific functionalities on the website**, like Login or Cart section.

Below is the **video recording** of the automation tests execution, written for testing of Faculty of History BBU website.
